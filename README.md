# Instructions for installing UNSW network printers on Linux

Since the instructions on [taggi](https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/Managed_Print_Service_at_CSE/) do not work for Linux (at least on my Ubuntu OS), here is step-by-step guide to installing one. It should work for both your university desktop as well as personal laptops.

1. Open Terminal and run (as a root user) the command: ```sudo apt install smbclient```
2. Open Settings -> Printers -> Additional Printer Settings. You should be able to see this on your screen
